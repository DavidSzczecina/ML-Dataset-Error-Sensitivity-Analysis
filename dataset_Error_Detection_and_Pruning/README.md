# InternationalBarcodeOfLife
Collaborating on research for the International Barcode of Life BIOSCAN program for the university of Waterloo


Conducting research to enable a far more extensive and detailed understanding of global biodiversity and the interactions between species and ecosystems.
Collaboration on the BIOSCAN Program, part of the International Barcode of Life (iBOL) project.
Increased Machine Learning model accuracy using Confident Learning for error detection in data


Key Achievements
Increased Deep Learning model accuracy using Confident Learning for error detection in datasets.
Identified mislabeled data in multiple datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet.
Performed analysis of how accuracy and loss are affected by mislabeling of common ML datasets.
